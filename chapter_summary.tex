%intro.
Systematic studies of the baryon-baryon interaction between octet baryons containing $s$ quarks ($\BB$ interaction) are important to understand the nuclear forces that shape matters in the world. Studying $\BB$ interactions is equivalent to investigating the properties of flavor SU(3) multiplets. Among them, ${\bf(8)_s}$ and ${\bf(10)}$ terms are predicted by QCM to be quite repulsive due to the Pauli effect at the quark level, which is related to the origin of the repulsive core of the nuclear force. In particular, for ${\bf(10)}$ term, the J-PARC E40 experiment newly measured the high statistic $\SPp$ ($\SN (I=3/2)$ channel) differential cross-sections in the momentum range of $0.44-0.80$ GeV/$c$., which greatly restricts theoretical models. As the same experiment measured the high statistic $\SMp$ ($\SN (I=1/2)$ channel) differential cross-sections in the momentum range of $0.47-0.85$ GeV/$c$ too, it is expected that the understanding of other terms will advance.

Based on the success of the above J-PARC E40 experiment, which pioneered the technique of $YN$ scattering experiment, we newly planned a next-generation $\Lp$ scattering experiment at J-PARC (J-PARC E86). The beam $\Lambda$ generated by the $\PiKL$ reaction causes $\Lp$ scattering with the target proton in a LH$_{2}$ target. J-PARC E86 is scheduled to measure not only $\Lp$ differential cross-sections but also spin observables (analyzing power $\anapow$ and depolarization $\depo$) in the momentum range of $0.4-0.8$ GeV/$c$. $\Lp$ spin observable measurement requires a highly polarized beam $\Lambda$, and its value must also be measured. Past experiments (Ref. \cite{Baker}) have reported that $\Lambda$ derived from the $\PiKL$ reaction is almost 100\% polarized in the forward $\Kz$ scattering angle range, but it is uncertain since the statistics are small. To verify the result, we began to precisely measure $\Lambda$ polarization assuming the J-PARC E40 setup and to establish the analysis method. In this paper, as a basic research for J-PARC E86, the $\Lp$ scattering identification method and the beam $\Lambda$ polarization measurement method necessary for $\Lp$ spin observable measurements were developed. The $\PiKL$ reaction data obtained by the J-PARC E40 experiment (in $\SM$ production) was used for the analysis.

%exp.
The $\Sp$ scattering experiment (J-PARC E40) \cite{Miwa-AIP2019} \cite{Miwa-JP2020} was conducted at the K1.8 beamline in the J-PARC Hadron Experimental Facility. In the $\SM$ production, the 1.33 GeV/$c$ $\pM$ beam with $2.0\times10^{7}$/spill was generated from the 30 GeV proton beam with a spill cycle of 5.2 seconds and a beam duration of 2 seconds. When the $\PiKL$ reaction occurs inside the LH$_{2}$ target, each $\Kz$ was reconstructed from the decay $\pM$ and decay $\pP$ analyzed by a cylindrical detector cluster (CATCH) and a forward magnetic spectrometer (KURAMA), respectively. The momentum of each $\Lambda$ was tagged as the missing momentum calculated by the $\pM$ beam analyzed at the K1.8 beamline spectrometer \cite{K1.8} and the reconstructed $\Kz$. In the detection case \rom{1}, where CATCH was requested to detect proton and $\pM$ of the $\Ldecay$ decay, $6.976\times10^{4}$ $\Lambda$s were tagged with S/N$=1.523$. In the detection case \rom{2}, where CATCH was requested to detect recoil proton of $\Lp$ scattering and decay products of $\scatldecay$ decay, $2.721\times10^{3}$ $\Lambda$s were tagged with S/N$=1.471$. 

%PL
The beam $\Lambda$ polarization ($\PL$) measurement was performed in detection case \rom{1} since it requires the $\Ldecay$ decay-only events. The $\PL$ is synonymous with the slope of the emission angle distribution of decay protons in the rest frame of $\Lambda$ ($\costp$), so its value was determined by experimentally measuring the $\costp$ distribution. After correcting the measured $\costp$ distribution by the CATCH detection efficiency, we fitted it with a certain function and measured the $\PL$ values. Our measurement was performed in the $\Kz$ scattering angle range of $0.6<\costkz<1.0$ with an angular step of $d\costkz=0.05$ (finer angular interval than Ref. \cite{Baker}). As a result, we confirmed that the average polarization in the angle region of $0.6<\costkz<0.85$ is extremely high as $0.917\pm0.059\pm0.003$. If considering that J-PARC E86 will install SKS, whose momentum resolution is $\Delta p/p = 10^{-3}$ (FWHM), and upgrade the beamline detectors, the number of tagged $\Lambda$ of the $\PiKL$ reaction is expected to increase to 50M, about 1000 times that in the J-PARC E40. In this case, the statistical error of $\PL$ can be improved to about 10\% of that of J-PARC E40. From all of the above, we concluded that by selecting the specific $\Kz$ scattering angular range using a vast amount of tagged $\Lambda$, it is possible to measure $\PL$ with great accuracy. Then, it would be possible to precisely measure the spin observables of $\Lp$ for the first time by the experimental side.

%Lp id.
The $\Lp$ scattering identification was performed in detection case \rom{2} with/without $\pM$ detection. To estimate the background contaminations, Geant4-based Monte Carlo simulation, which generates $pp$ elastic scattering, $\Ldecay$ decay, and $\Lp$ scattering, was performed. We found that in the case without decay $\pM$, at least 39 counts of $\Lp$ scattering events were identified with S/N$=11.678$. In the case with decay $\pM$, we finally identified at least 14 counts of $\Lp$ scattering events with a high accuracy of S/N$=17.979$. Although it is thought that there are still unknown background events that the simulation cannot predict, it is considered that it is possible to identify $\Lp$ scattering events with a high S/N using the analysis method developed in this study. When we obtain high statistics in future J-PARC E86 experiments, we precisely identify $\Lp$ scattering events and derive the differential cross-section.

%last
In the $YN$ channel, the data on spin-dependent terms were historically lacking due to the difficulty of the experimental technique. However, the analyzing power $\anapow$ is expected to be sensitive to the ALS force, and the depolarization $\depo$ would preserve information on the tensor force \cite{Ishikawa-2004}. To make the theoretical models more realistic beyond the basic understandings established mainly by the $NN$ scattering data, the J-PARC E86 will provide essential experimental inputs on the spin-dependent terms of the $\BB$ interaction potential.
