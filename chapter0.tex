\chapter{Abstract}
The J-PARC E40 experiment succeeded in measuring the differential cross-sections of the $\SPMp$ scattering and $\SMpLn$ inelastic scattering. It used a high intensity $\pi$ beam of $20$ M/spill ($1$ spill $= 5.2$ sec with a beam duration of $2$ sec) at beam momentum of $1.41$ GeV/$c$ for a $\pP$ beam, and $1.33$ GeV/$c$ for a $\pM$ beam, at the J-PARC Hadron Experimental Facility from 2018 to 2020. Scattering particles were detected by the cylindrical detector cluster (CATCH) and the forward magnetic spectrometer (KURAMA). Following this success, to offer precise experimental data on the $\LN$ channel, the next-generation $\Lp$ scattering experiment (J-PARC E86) where the beam $\Lambda$ derived from the $\PiKL$ reaction will cause $\Lp$ scattering, will be performed. 

The J-PARC E86 aims to measure the differential cross-section and spin observables, such as the analyzing power $\anapow$ and the depolarization $\depo$ of $\Lp$ scattering. Due to the prohibition of asymmetric spin-orbit (ALS) force for the isospin symmetry in the $NN$ channels and the experimental difficulty of $YN$ scattering, the experimental data of these spin observables are historically lacking. They can probe into the symmetric and asymmetric spin-orbit (SLS and ALS) forces and tensor force \cite{Ishikawa-2004}. Therefore, this measurement could restrict the present $\BB$ interaction models. Here, the beam $\Lambda$ should be polarized to measure the spin observables, and we need to know its polarization value $\PL$. Therefore, the $\PiKL$ reaction data with $1.32$ GeV/$c$ $\pM$ beam accumulated in J-PARC E40 was analyzed in this paper as a basic study for J-PARC E86. $\PL$ value was measured by the emission angle distribution of decay protons from beam $\Lambda$ in the $\Kz$ scattering angular range $0.6<\costkz<1.0$ with an angular step of $d\costkz=0.05$. The averaged $\PL$ value was $0.917\pm0.059\pm0.003$ in the range of $0.6<\costkz<0.85$. That means it is possible to measure spin observables using a nearly 100\% polarized beam $\Lambda$ by selecting such a specific angular range in the J-PARC E86 experiment. 

In addition, we performed the $\Lp$ scattering identification using the same data. When all final state particles (recoil proton, decay products of scattered $\Lambda$) were detected, at least 15 counts of $\Lp$ scattering events were identified with a high accuracy of S/N$=17.9785$. That means the $\Lp$ scattering identification method developed this time can be applied to J-PARC E86, and it will be possible to measure the differential cross-sections with higher statistics and accuracy.

Based on the beam $\Lambda$ polarization measurement and the $\Lp$ scattering identification methods established in this paper, J-PARC E86 would measure the differential cross-section and spin observables of $\Lp$ scattering. Since the experimental data on the $\LN$ channel are still lacking, it could be an essential input for establishing more realistic $\BB$ interaction models beyond the problem that current models have been built based on $NN$ scattering data and a few hyperon-nucleon ($YN$) scattering data. 

%J-PARC E40 was performed using the cylindrical detector cluster (CATCH) and the forward magnetic spectrometer (KURAMA) at the J-PARC K1.8 beamline in the J-PARC Hadron Experimental Facility. It measured the differential cross-sections of $\SPMp$ scatterings and $\SMpLn$ inelastic scattering with a high intensity $\pi$ beam of $20$ M/spill ($1$ spill $= 5.2$ sec with a beam duration of $2$ sec) at beam momentum of $1.41$ GeV/$c$ for a $\pP$ beam, and $1.33$ GeV/$c$ for a $\pM$ beam, respectively. Owing to a kinematical consistency analyses, J-PARC E40 succeeded in tagging the produced $\Sigma^{\pm}$s: $4.9\times10^7$ $\SP$s, and $1.62\times10^7$ $\SM$s. Using these momentum-tagged $\Sigma^{\pm}$ beams, the differential cross-sections were measured in the momentum range of $440 - 800$ MeV/$c$ ($\SPp$ scattering), $470 - 850$ MeV/$c$ ($\SMp$ scattering), and $470 - 650$ MeV/$c$ ($\SMpLn$ inelastic scattering) \cite{Nana-SPp} \cite{Miwa-SMp} \cite{Miwa-SMLn}.
