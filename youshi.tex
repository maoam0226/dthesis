\section{Introduction}
\label{sec-intro}

The study focuses on the $\BB$ interaction involving octet baryons with $s$ quarks, aiming to understand nuclear forces and flavor SU(3) multiplets. Theoretical predictions suggest repulsiveness in ${\bf(8)_s}$ and ${\bf(10)}$ terms due to the Pauli effect at the quark level. The J-PARC E40 experiment measured $\SPp$ ($\SN (I=3/2)$) and $\SMp$ ($\SN (I=1/2)$) cross-sections, with the upcoming J-PARC E86 experiment aiming to measure spin observables and differential cross-section of $\Lp$ scattering. 

As the basic research for J-PARC E86, this paper performed the beam $\Lambda$ polarization ($\PL$) measurement and the $\Lp$ scattering identification using the $\PiKL$ reaction data accumulated in J-PARC E40. In the $\PL$ measurement, we address the necessity of a highly polarized $\Lambda$ beam for $\Lp$ spin observable measurement. Ref. \cite{Baker} reported almost 100\% polarization of $\Lambda$ in the forward $\Kz$ scattering angular range at $E_{CM}=1847$ MeV (same as J-PARC E40), as depicted in Figure \ref{fig-Baker1847}, but uncertainty existed due to small statistics. Therefore, this paper verified the result of Ref. \cite{Baker} and established a polarization analysis method by measuring $\PL$ using the E40 data. In the $\Lp$ scattering identification, we developed a kinematical consistency analysis, which checks whether the tagged $\Lambda$ was derived from the $\PiKL$ reaction or not. The main backgrounds, such as multiple $\pi$ production, $pp$ elastic scattering, and $\Ldecay$ decay, were rejected by optimized cuts and S/N was estimated by Geant4 simulation. 

%Systematic studies of the baryon-baryon interaction between octet baryons containing $s$ quarks ($\BB$ interaction) are important to understand the nuclear forces that shape matters in the world. Studying $\BB$ interactions is equivalent to investigating the properties of flavor SU(3) multiplets. Among them, ${\bf(8)_s}$ and ${\bf(10)}$ terms are predicted by QCM to be quite repulsive due to the Pauli effect at the quark level. Since the $\BB$ interaction can be represented by a combination of linear couplings in six irreducible representations, studying the structure of each term could reveal the origin of the repulsion of the nuclear force. 
%Recently, the J-PARC E40 experiment measured the $\SPp$ ($\SN (I=3/2)$) and $\SMp$ ($\SN (I=1/2)$) differential cross-sections. Following them, a next-generation $\Lambda p$ scattering experiment, J-PARC E86, will be performed in the K1.1 beamline at J-PARC soon. It aims to measure not only differential cross-section but also spin observables such as analyzing power and depolarization in the beam momentum range of $0.4-0.8$ GeV/$c$. $\Lp$ spin observable measurement requires a highly polarized beam $\Lambda$, and its value must be measured. Ref. \cite{Baker} have reported that $\Lambda$ of the $\PiKL$ reaction is almost 100\% polarized in the forward $\Kz$ scattering angle range in the energy range of $E_{CM}=1847$ MeV (same as J-PARC E40), as shown in Figure \ref{fig-Baker1847}. However, it was uncertain since its statistics were small. In this paper, to verify the past result and establish the polarization analysis method, we tried to measure the $\Lambda$ polarization using  $\PiKL$ reaction data obtained by the J-PARC E40 experiment (in $\SM$ production). Also, $\Lp$ scattering identification was performed using the same data.

\section{Beam $\Lambda$ identification}
\label{sec-LbeamID}

$\Kz$ was reconstructed using $\pM$ and $\pP$ vectors detected by a cylindrical detector cluster (CATCH) and a forward magnetic spectrometer (KURAMA), respectively. Then, $\Lambda$ was tagged as missing momentum of $\PiKX$ reaction. The $\Lambda$ beam polarization measurement required CATCH to detect decay products of $\Ldecay$ decay (case \rom{1}). The $\Lp$ scattering events were identification required CATCH to detect recoil proton and decay products of $\scatldecay$ decay (case \rom{2}).

%The missing mass in case \rom{1} and case \rom{2} are shown in Figure \ref{fig-mm0_1p1pi}, and Figure \ref{fig-mm0_2p}. 
Each missing mass in case \rom{1} and case \rom{2} was fitted with a function that combines two Gaussians and a \nth{3}-order polynomial, as represented by the red solid lines. The $\Lambda$ region was defined as the range of $1.0707 - 1.1626$ GeV/$c^{2}$. The yields of $\Lambda$ peak in case \rom{1} and case \rom{2} were $6.976\times10^{4}$ (S/N$=1.523$), and $2.721\times10^{3}$ (S/N$=1.471$).

\section{Analysis \rom{1}: Beam $\Lambda$ polarization measurement}
\label{sec-Pl}

In case \rom{1}, $\PL$ can be obtained by fitting the emission angle distribution ($\costp$) of decay protons of $\Ldecay$ decay using the following equation.
\begin{equation}
  \frac{dN}{d\costp} = \frac{N_0}{2}(1+\alpha\PL\costp), 
  \label{eq-costp}
\end{equation}
where $N$ is the yield of each bin, and $N_0$ represents the total yield of $\costp$. We measured $\PL$ in the $\Kz$ scattering angular range of $0.6<\costkz<1.0$ with an angular step of $d\costkz = 0.05$. To get a better $\chisq$ of the fitting, we investigated the best degree of freedom in each $\costkz$ range. Figure \ref{fig-Pl} shows the results of the E40 data with a selected degree of freedom (red points), the results of the E40 data with a full degree of freedom (blue points), and results in Ref. \cite{Baker} (green points). 

The average $\PL$ value obtained with a selected degree of freedom was $\sim0.917\pm0.059\pm0.003$ in the $\costkz$ range of $0.6 - 0.85$. Therefore, we concluded that by selecting this specific $\costkz$ region, we could use a beam $\Lambda$ with high polarization, resulting in that $\Lp$ spin observable measurement is fully possible in J-PARC E86.

\section{Analysis \rom{2}: $\Lp$ scattering identification}
\label{sec-Lp_2p}

In detection case \rom{2}, $\Lp$ scattering can be identified by kinematical consistency analysis called \say{$\Delta E-\Delta p$} method. Here, the kinetic energy of the recoil proton and momentum of scattered $\Lambda$ ($\Lambda'$) were kinematically calculated under the $\Lp$ scattering kinematics assumption. The contamination of backgrounds ($pp$ elastic scattering and $\Ldecay$ decay) was estimated by Geant4 simulation. 

As a result, the yield of $\Lp$ scattering events was expected at most 14 with the S/N estimated by the simulation was 17.979. Therefore, we can say it is possible to identify $\Lp$ scattering events with a high S/N using the analysis method developed in this paper, although it is expected that there are still unknown background events that the simulation cannot predict. When we obtain high statistics in J-PARC E86, we can rigorously estimate the background structure and yield of $\Lp$ scatterings.

\section{Summary}
\label{sec-summary}

As the basic research for J-PARC E86, the $\PL$ measurement, and the $\Lp$ scattering identification were performed using the $\PiKL$ reaction data accumulated in J-PARC E40. %$\Kz$ was reconstructed by $\pM$ and $\pP$ detected by CATCH and KURAMA, respectively. Then, $\Lambda$ was tagged by the missing mass of the $\PiKX$ reaction. 
In the detection case \rom{1} where CATCH detects decay products of $\Ldecay$ decay, $\Lambda$ yield was $6.976\times10^{4}$ with S/N$=1.523$. In the detection case \rom{2} where CATCH detects the recoil proton and decay products of $\scatldecay$ decay, $\Lambda$ yield was $2.721\times10^{3}$ with S/N$=1.471$. 

%The beam $\Lambda$ polarization ($\PL$) was obtained by fitting the emission angle distribution ($\costp$) of decay protons of $\Ldecay$ decay using Equation (\ref{eq-costp}) in case \rom{1}. As a result, the average $\PL$ value measured in E40 data was $\sim0.917\pm0.059\pm0.003$ in the $\costkz$ range of $0.6 - 0.85$. Therefore, we concluded that by selecting this specific $\costkz$ region, we could use a beam $\Lambda$ with high polarization, resulting in that $\Lp$ spin observable measurement is fully possible in J-PARC E86.

%The $\Lp$ scattering can be identified by kinematical consistency analysis (\say{$\Delta E-\Delta p$} method) in case \rom{2}. In the range of $|\Delta E|<20$ MeV and $|\Delta p|<0.05$ GeV/$c$, the S/N estimated by Geant4 simulation was 17.979, and the yield of $\Lp$ scattering events was expected at most 14. Therefore, we can say it is possible to identify $\Lp$ scattering events with a high S/N using the analysis method developed in this paper, although it is expected that there are still unknown background events that the simulation cannot predict. When we obtain high statistics in J-PARC E86, we can rigorously fit $\Delta p$ and $\Delta E$ spectra and estimate the yield of $\Lp$ scattering events. 
The yield of $\Lp$ scattering identified in case \rom{2} was 14 with S/N estimated by Geant4 simulation of 17.979. Therefore, we concluded that identifying $\Lp$ scatterings with a high S/N is possible by the analysis method developed in this paper. When we obtain high statistics in J-PARC E86, we can rigorously estimate the background structure and $\Lp$ scattering yield.
