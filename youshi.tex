\section{Introduction}
\label{sec-intro}

This paper focuses on baryon-baryon ($\BB$) interactions, aiming to understand the nuclear force from quark degree of freedom by extending to flavor SU(3) symmetry. The J-PARC E40 experiment measured $\SPp$ ($\SN (I=3/2)$) and $\SMp$ ($\SN (I=1/2)$) cross-sections to investigate the repulsiveness from the quark Pauli effect in ${\bf(8)_s}$ and ${\bf(10)}$ terms. Next, the new $\Lp$ scattering experiment (J-PARC E86) will measure the differential cross-section and spin observables. Building realistic $\LN$ interactions by accumulating two-body scattering data is essential for studying many-body systems such as hypernuclei and neutron stars.

As the basic research for J-PARC E86, we performed the beam $\Lambda$ polarization ($\PL$) measurement and the $\Lp$ scattering identification using the $\PiKL$ reaction data taken in J-PARC E40. In the $\PL$ measurement, we address the necessity of a highly polarized $\Lambda$ beam. Ref. \cite{Baker} reported that the beam $\Lambda$ is almost 100\% polarized in the forward $\Kz$ scattering angular range at $E_{CM}=1847$ MeV (same as J-PARC E40), as shown in Figure \ref{fig-Baker1847}, but uncertainty existed due to small statistics. Therefore, this paper has verified the result of Ref. \cite{Baker} by measuring $\PL$. In the $\Lp$ scattering identification, we developed kinematical consistency analysis methods. The main backgrounds, such as multiple $\pi$ production, $pp$ elastic scattering, and $\Ldecay$ decay, were removed by optimized cuts and S/N was estimated by Geant4 simulation.

\section{Analsis \rom{1}: Beam $\Lambda$ identification}
\label{sec-LbeamID}

The $\Kz$ from the $\PiKL$ reaction was reconstructed using $\pM$ and $\pP$ vectors detected by a cylindrical detector cluster (CATCH) and a forward magnetic spectrometer (KURAMA), respectively. Then, $\Lambda$ was tagged from the missing mass of the $\PiKX$ reaction. The $\PL$ measurement required CATCH to detect decay products of $\Ldecay$ decay (case \rom{1}). The $\Lp$ scattering identification required CATCH to detect recoil proton and decay products of $\scatldecay$ decay (case \rom{2}).

Each missing mass in case \rom{1} and case \rom{2} was fitted with two Gaussians and a \nth{3}-order polynomial. The $\Lambda$ region was defined as the $1.0707 - 1.1626$ GeV/$c^{2}$ range. The yields of $\Lambda$ peak in case \rom{1} and case \rom{2} were $6.976\times10^{4}$ (S/N = 1.523), and $2.721\times10^{3}$ (S/N = 1.471).

\section{Analysis \rom{2}: Beam $\Lambda$ polarization measurement}
\label{sec-Pl}

In case \rom{1}, $\PL$ can be obtained by fitting the emission angle distribution of decay protons in the rest frame of $\Lambda$ ($\costp$) with
\begin{equation}
  \frac{dN}{d\costp} = \frac{N_0}{2}(1+\alpha\PL\costp), 
  \label{eq-costp}
\end{equation}
where $N$ is the yield of each $\costp$ bin, $N_0$ is the total yield of $\costp$, and $\alpha$ is an asymmetry parameter ($\alpha=0.750\pm0.009\pm0.004$ \cite{Alpha}). $\PL$ was obtained in the $\Kz$ scattering angular range ($\costkz$) of 0.6 - 1.0 with an angular step of $d\costkz = 0.05$. Due to the uncertainty in the correction of CATCH acceptance, an angular region deviates from the expected distribution in $\costp$. Therefore, the angular region used for fitting was optimized using a $\chisq$ test. Figure \ref{fig-Pl} shows the results of the E40 data with a selected degree of freedom (red points), the results of the E40 data with a full degree of freedom (blue points), and results in Ref. \cite{Baker} (green points). 

The average $\PL$ value obtained with a selected degree of freedom was $0.917\pm0.059\pm0.003$ in the $\costkz$ range of 0.6 - 0.85. Therefore, we concluded that by selecting this specific $\costkz$ region, we could use a beam $\Lambda$ with high polarization, resulting in that $\Lp$ spin observable measurement is fully possible in J-PARC E86.

\section{Analysis \rom{3}: $\Lp$ scattering identification}
\label{sec-Lp_2p}

In case \rom{2}, $\Lp$ scattering can be identified by kinematical consistency analysis called \say{$\Delta E\Delta p$ method}. Here, the kinetic energy of the recoil proton and momentum of scattered $\Lambda$ ($\Lambda'$) were kinematically calculated assuming the $\Lp$ scattering kinematics. %The contamination of backgrounds ($pp$ elastic scattering and $\Ldecay$ decay) was estimated by Geant4 simulation. 
As a result, the yield of $\Lp$ scattering events was expected at most 14 with the estimated S/N of 18. Therefore, we concluded that it is possible to identify $\Lp$ scattering events with a high S/N using the analysis method developed in this paper, although it is expected that there are still unknown background events that the simulation cannot reproduce. When we obtain high statistics in J-PARC E86, we can rigorously estimate the background structure and yield of $\Lp$ scatterings.

\section{Summary}
\label{sec-summary}

As the basic research for J-PARC E86, the $\PL$ measurement and the $\Lp$ scattering identification were performed using the $\PiKL$ reaction data taken in J-PARC E40. %$\Kz$ was reconstructed by $\pM$ and $\pP$ detected by CATCH and KURAMA, respectively. Then, $\Lambda$ was tagged by the missing mass of the $\PiKX$ reaction. 

%The beam $\Lambda$ polarization ($\PL$) was obtained by fitting the emission angle distribution ($\costp$) of decay protons of $\Ldecay$ decay using Equation (\ref{eq-costp}) in case \rom{1}. As a result, the average $\PL$ value measured in E40 data was $\sim0.917\pm0.059\pm0.003$ in the $\costkz$ range of $0.6 - 0.85$. Therefore, we concluded that by selecting this specific $\costkz$ region, we could use a beam $\Lambda$ with high polarization, resulting in that $\Lp$ spin observable measurement is fully possible in J-PARC E86.
The $\PL$ measurement in case \rom{1} used the tagged $\Lambda$ of $6.976\times10^{4}$ (S/N $=1.523$) and found that the averaged $\PL$ value was $0.917\pm0.059\pm0.003$ in the $\costkz$ range of 0.6 - 0.85. Therefore, we concluded that by selecting this specific $\costkz$ region, $\Lp$ spin observable measurement is possible in J-PARC E86.

%The $\Lp$ scattering can be identified by kinematical consistency analysis (\say{$\Delta E-\Delta p$} method) in case \rom{2}. In the range of $|\Delta E|<20$ MeV and $|\Delta p|<0.05$ GeV/$c$, the S/N estimated by Geant4 simulation was 17.979, and the yield of $\Lp$ scattering events was expected at most 14. Therefore, we can say it is possible to identify $\Lp$ scattering events with a high S/N using the analysis method developed in this paper, although it is expected that there are still unknown background events that the simulation cannot predict. When we obtain high statistics in J-PARC E86, we can rigorously fit $\Delta p$ and $\Delta E$ spectra and estimate the yield of $\Lp$ scattering events. 
The $\Lp$ scattering identification in case \rom{2} used the tagged $\Lambda$ of $2.721\times10^{3}$ (S/N $=1.471$). The final yield of the scattering was 14 with the estimated S/N of 18. Therefore, we concluded that identifying $\Lp$ scatterings with a high S/N is possible by the analysis method developed in this paper. When we obtain high statistics in J-PARC E86, we can rigorously estimate the background structure and $\Lp$ scattering yield.
