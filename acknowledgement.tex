Throughout the writing of this dissertation, I have received a great deal of support and assistance. This has truly been a wonderful journey.

First, I would like to thank my advisor, Dr. Koji Miwa, for his great insight. He is the most hardworking and kind person I have ever met. He was very helpful in breaking down the validity of the analysis in our meetings, providing advice, and was always willing to take time out of his busy schedule to assist me. I am grateful to him for guiding me so much during these five years. He gave me many experimental experiences and always encouraged and nurtured me. Thank you for everything. I wish you great success in the future.

Next, I would like to thank Dr. Hirokazu Tamura for his great expertise. He is a friendly, warm-hearted person with a great sense of humor who always cares for his students. His skill in demystifying complex physics topics has always guided me. I would like to thank you from the bottom of my heart for watching over me and nurturing me since I was first assigned to this laboratory in 2018.

Our laboratory members, Dr. Satoshi N. Nakamura, Dr. Yudai Ichikawa, Dr. Mifuyu Ukai, Dr. Takeshi Koike, Dr. Masashi Kaneta, and Dr. Shuhei Hayakawa have provided careful guidance and warm support through my studies. Thank you for being so supportive. Your intelligence and enthusiasm for research will continue to be the best role models for me.

I would like to thank Hiroo Umezu, a technical staff member, for his dedicated efforts. He made parts for experimental equipment and took care of documentation to always support us. I thank Ayumi Takahashi, a secretary member, for her vitality and politeness. She supported my time at the laboratory by taking on various tasks, from administering KAKENHI funds to handling university administrative procedures. Whenever I met her, she was full of energy, and she always encouraged me.

I would like to thank Dr. Ryotaro Honda (KEK), Dr. Toshiyuki Gogami (Kyoto University), Dr. Sho Nagao (University of Tokyo), Dr. Takeshi Yamamoto (JAEA), Dr. Yuya Akazawa, Dr. Manami Fujita (JAEA), Dr. Kosuke Itabashi (University of Tokyo) and Dr. Yuichi Toyama (Chubu University) for their great support and guidance.

I have made many friendships with seniors, classmates, and juniors at this laboratory. They have always been there to lend a hand and enjoy physics when needed. Thank you Anya Rogers, Takeru Akiyama, Kazuki Okuyama, Shunsuke Kajikawa, Kento Kamada, Masaya Mizuno, Fumiya Oura, Ryoko Kino, Tatsuhiro Ishige, Kazuma Ohashi, Tomomasa Kitaoka, Chesu Son, Hayato Miyata, Daigo Watanabe, Ryo Imamoto, Rintaro Kurata, and Ryuta Saito.

In addition to the above, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to everyone who participated in the numerous experiments at J-PARC. The time I spent at the experimental facility was a very valuable experience and has become an irreplaceable memory.

Finally, and above all, I dedicate this paper to my family. I am truly grateful to my mother and father. I couldn't have gotten here without their love and support. Thank you with love.
